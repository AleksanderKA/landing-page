The Odin Project

All 5 sections have been added and basic elements placed, needs much more work with aligning. Code came out definitely messy. 

Due to time constraints I will move on to learning JavaScript due to time constraints and me needing it for school, but I hope to 
revisit this project in the future with hopefully better knowledge on how to use flexbox.
